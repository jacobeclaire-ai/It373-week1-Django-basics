At first, I struggled a lot with the assignment because I wasnâ€™t familiar with setting up Django. Installing the necessary tools and configuring everything properly took me longer than I expected. 
I encountered several errors, and at times I felt frustrated, but I slowly figured things out by checking online tutorials and asking classmates for advice. 
Step by step, the errors became easier to handle, and I started to understand how things worked.
Another challenge came when I had to work with the virtual environment and VS Code. It was a bit confusing at first, but once I got it running, I felt more confident in continuing with my project. 
The biggest obstacle for me, however, was learning how to use GitHub. Since I had very little experience with it, I often got stuck and had to backtrack.
What really helped me was having a copy of the class recording. Being able to replay the lessons made it easier to follow instructions and correct my mistakes. 
In the end, the whole process taught me patience and persistence, and I enjoyed the sense of accomplishment once I finished.
